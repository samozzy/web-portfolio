The Nottingham New Theatre ran a Wordpress installation, which we reworked in 2019 to turn it into a Jekyll site. The redesign is cleaner and reduced the number of pages from dozens to 10, 8 of which are top-level pages. This increased the ease of finding key information, and put booking tickets at the front-level. 

The design is responsive, and formalises the theatre's brand identity across its web platforms, a number of which I've been involved in the development of. Here, I led the design and development process, including integration with the ticketing platform via a JSON API, and the writing of the copy.
