The Nottingham New Theatre's summer arts festival - StuFF - previously used a shared Google Doc to display performing companies' technical requirements. This was great for centralising the info, but poor for quickly finding content, especially from a mobile device.

This website, built using Django, is able to record and display technical requirements for changeovers, as well as allow staff to input technical and front of house reporting. It integrates with the existing ticketing platform to serve as an initial portal for front of house staff, while allowing technical staff to work independently to see what's needed for the changeovers.

I created and developed the project, as well as acted as technical support throughout the 2019 festival - the first festival it was used.
