That's this very website you're looking at! I've included it for completeness, and it's a great example of a one-page portfolio. It focuses on the key projects and is fully mobile-responsive, using a simple two-column format of displaying the content. Using YAML within the projects, it's possible to quickly and easily specify what gets included and ensure consistent formatting.
