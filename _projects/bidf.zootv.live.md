Birmingham International Dance Festival was held online in 2021, for the first time in its history. BIDF worked with Zoo Venues, having premiered their online festival - Zoo TV - in lieu of the in-person Edinburgh Festival in 2020.

Zoo then reached out to me to rebuild their Squarespace site into a bespoke solution. Using Jekyll with Bootstrap ensured the design was slick and easy to use, and adding Forestry meant it was painless for the editing team to update during the festival. All the events are stored throughout the festival, and the site is rebuilt at 15-minute intervals to ensure the right events are available at the right time.
