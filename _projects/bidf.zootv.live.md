Birmingham International Dance Festival was held online in 2021, for the first time in its history. BIDF worked with Zoo Venues, having premiered their online festival - Zoo TV - in lieu of the in-person Edinburgh Festival in 2020.

Zoo then reached out to me to rebuild their Squarespace site into a bespoke solution. I used the power of Jekyll's fast build times to create rapid prototypes, ensuring the full design was slick and easy -- and quick to edit. All the events are stored throughout the festival, and the site is rebuilt at 15-minute intervals to ensure the right events are available at the right time.
