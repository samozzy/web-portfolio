Having worked with ZOO for their digital projects in 2021, they returned to me to create their online digital programme for in-person performances for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2022. 

The site was designed to reflect the design of their previous printed brochures, done away with to reduce their environmental impact. The brief was a clean, easy to browse programme, with the cool style ZOO is known for. Alongside this, responsive filtering was incorporated so that users across all devices could find shows just for them with ease and minimal waiting times. The site received great acclaim in Edinburgh across both ZOO and the wider Fringe.

We have refreshed the site each year and it is still in use for the 2025 festival.
