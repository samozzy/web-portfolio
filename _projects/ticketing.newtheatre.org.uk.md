The Nottingham New Theatre uses a bespoke ticketing platform to market shows, sell tickets, and collate sales reports over time. It uses Django and integrates with the public website with an API on the audience frontend, with a Materialize UI designed for front of house staff use on the backend.

I have developed features for the platform including displaying content warnings, adding draft event support, advancing the use of the website for the theatre's summer festival, and increasing the amount of information available to audiences at the point of reserving tickets.
