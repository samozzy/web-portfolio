ZOOTV debuted as part of ZOO Venues' shift to online content for the 2020 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Following the completion of BIDF TV in June, ZOO contracted me to rebuild last year's site using the BIDF structure and architecture.

ZOOTV hosts a mixture of live and on-demand content, all of which is behind an InPlayer paywall. ZOO also sells some of its tickets via the EdFringe ticket portal, so it was essential we were able to build in direct access to those customers who already held tickets.

Timed builds allow for events to disappear once they have finished their run, and allows the ZOO staff to focus on the in-person programme they're running simultaneously in 2021.
