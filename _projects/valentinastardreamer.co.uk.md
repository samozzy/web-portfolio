Valentina Star Dreamer is a new digital show for families by Haste Theatre & Mouths of Lions Theatre. They were looking for a companion website, to share information about Valentina Tereshkova (first woman in space) and provide some further engagement for audiences.

I designed and developed an information hub, as well as an interactive 'code-breaker' game, to engage children and their families alike, incorporating the style and visuals from their poster design.
