Codamotion approached me to transfer their self-described broken Wordpress website, where the plugins had stopped working, to a Django offering. I redesigned their database structure to be in line with their business needs, streamlining data entry, and rebuilt the design in Bootstrap from scratch. 

The result is cleaner code that is easier to maintain, using modern tools, while maintaining the same look and feel as their original.
