Sightlines Festival is a new, online, performance and wellbeing festival that premiered in July 2021. They were looking for a site that showcased their events, editorials, and team, while linking through to a 3rd-party ticketing platform.

Jekyll was the perfect choice for this, while using GitHub Actions to schedule nightly builds and refresh the event listings to remove the previous day's programme. I worked alongside their graphic designer to be in-keeping with the colourful scheme with bold lines to create an adaptive, modern design.
