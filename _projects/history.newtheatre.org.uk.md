The Nottingham New Theatre History Project is an archive of the theatre from 1945 to the present day. The archive includes shows, people, committees and just about anything that's happened under the roof of the theatre.

It uses Jekyll and static files instead of a database, increasing load times and security of the site. It integrates with Smugmug to display images and other media throughout the website, reducing bloat of the repository.

My role includes adding new shows and people to the site, as well as developing the templates to add new features, such as reviews, awards, and displaying a visual plan of which seats have dedication plaques on them.
