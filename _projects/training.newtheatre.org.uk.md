The Company Technical Director of The Nottingham New Theatre is responsible for, amongst other things, training technical crews of the theatre. I took on this role in 2017, and up to that point the theatre's training records was a binder of paper training records. This made updating the training scheme and ensuring consistent training incredibly difficult, and meant that members couldn't easily view their own training progress.

I designed and built an online training platform to display the training scheme, allow members to view their own individual profiles, and include training 'sessions' where multiple training items are signed off in one go. This has meant viewing who's trained in what, and by whom, is now easier than ever, and has since extended beyond the technical department to workshop, stage, and costume/make-up.
